 *
 * @param {Object} loan - The loan details
 * @param {number} loan.financed_amount - The amount financed for the loan
 * @param {string} loan.loan_start_date - The start date of the loan
 * @param {number} loan.loan_length_in_months - The length of the loan in months
 * @param {number} loan.interest_rate - The interest rate for the loan
 * @param {number} loan.calculated_current_loan_balance - The calculated current balance of the loan
 * @param {number} loan.calculated_monthly_payment_expense - The calculated monthly payment amount
